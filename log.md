2025-09-24 10:00:00 - Initializing agent. Read `prompt.md` and `task.md`.
2025-09-24 10:01:00 - Verified existence of `requirements.md`, `todo.md`, `log.md`, `results.md`. Created missing files.
2025-09-24 10:02:00 - Populated `requirements.md` with high-level game requirements based on `task.md`.
2025-09-24 10:03:00 - Populated `todo.md` with initial tasks derived from `task.md`.
2025-09-24 10:05:00 - Analyzed game idea and provided initial feedback. Identified strengths and considerations regarding mechanics, fuel, game structure, customization, and monetization. Key points include clarifying 'squish' mechanics, ensuring clear jump timing feedback, defining glide control, balancing fuel economy, and considering level design implications.
2025-09-24 10:10:00 - Identified potential design holes in the game concept. These include: lack of clear goal, difficulty curve/onboarding, repetitiveness, camera control, collision/physics, visual clarity/art style, level editor adoption, monetization model conflict, 'zen mode' definition, and lack of obstacles/enemies/hazards.
2025-09-24 10:20:00 - Conducted market research for 3D ball platformer games using web search. Identified key existing titles (e.g., Marble Blast, Marble It Up!, Crazyroll 3D) and categorized them by gameplay style and monetization model. Prepared a preliminary report highlighting common themes, mechanics, and the divergence between premium and F2P monetization strategies. Emphasized the importance of physics, level design, and a clear monetization focus for the user's game.
2025-09-24 10:30:00 - Brainstormed and detailed monetization strategies for both mobile (F2P) and Steam (paid) platforms. For F2P, suggested energy systems, cosmetic customization, battle passes, in-game currency, and rewarded ads. For paid, suggested upfront purchase, DLC, optional cosmetic packs, and digital extras. Recommended prioritizing one model due to fundamental design differences.
2025-09-24 10:45:00 - Explored technical implementation possibilities. Recommended Unity as the primary game engine. Detailed approaches for core ball physics (Rigidbody, forces for rolling/jumping/slamming), squish/jump/slam mechanics (scaling, timing windows), fuel system (collectibles, UI, consumption), level design (modular assets, prototyping), level editor (in-game UI, serialization, backend for sharing), procedural generation (algorithms, seed system), customization (material/shader system), UI/UX, and backend services (Firebase/PlayFab). Also highlighted technical challenges like physics consistency and level editor robustness.
2025-09-24 10:50:00 - Documented all findings and recommendations in `results.md`.
2025-09-24 10:51:00 - Updated `todo.md` to mark task 7 as DONE.
