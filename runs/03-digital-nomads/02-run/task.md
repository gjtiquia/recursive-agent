I have been thinking about doing business which can help me escape the nine to five, whether it could be a SaaS or that I can provide some sort of service 

for context, I am a game developer, I also have web development skills 

the business I intend to operate, can be any business, in the broad market, solving pain points in any industry, or even make games only if they are profitable 

I realized that, a lot of my thinking has been limited to my geographical location, thinking about what small businesses in my area could use my expertise 

however, there are plenty of dig digital nomads in the world, who go to low cost of living places, like Southeast asia, to live while doing their online business 

one of the most notable people doing so is levelsio

I would like you to help me research different kinds of people, different kinds of digital nomads, where are they residing, and what kinds of businesses are there doing, the goal is so that I could somehow reference how they do it, and that I could also be one too 

be as detailed as you can, as close to execution plan and details as possible, I want to know how they found the pain points that they are solving, I want to know how they build the solutions to those pain points, I want to know how they do user acquisition, I want to know how to scale, I want to know the the legality of where to open up the company, how to get money from people around the world, I want to know if they outsource any work, I just want to know how to operate this whole thing
