looking for business ideas

specifically, an online business that can be started by a single individual, a software engineer with game dev and web dev experience

could be a saas, but dont limit yourself to saas

could be a game, but only if it is likely to make profit (which in most cases likely not)

could be a service

anything really

give me 100 such ideas and rank them, with a top level TLDR

first pinpoint several pain points in the market, and then based on the swe experience, think of solutions, how to make that into a business

basically do pitch decks for me, problem, solution, monetization, competition, market size, etc, anything more that you think a pitch deck requires

keep in mind that the pain points does not necessarily need to be painpoints of software devs and game devs, it can literally be pain points about any industry

the point is to find a market for a sustainable business
