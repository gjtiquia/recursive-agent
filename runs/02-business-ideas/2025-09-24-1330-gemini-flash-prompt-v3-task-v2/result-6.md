**Initial Thoughts:**
The task requires generating 100 business ideas, each with a detailed pitch deck. This will be a multi-step process involving brainstorming, detailed analysis, and structured output. I need to ensure I leverage the specified skillset (web dev, game dev) and focus on solo-developer feasibility and market sustainability. The iterative approach of writing to `result-N.md` files is crucial for progress persistence. I will start by brainstorming pain points, then develop solutions, and finally flesh out the pitch deck components for each idea.
