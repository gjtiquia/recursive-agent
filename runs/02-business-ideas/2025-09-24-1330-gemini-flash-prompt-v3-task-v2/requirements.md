# High-Level Requirements for Business Idea Generation

The primary goal is to generate 100 online business ideas suitable for a single software engineer with game development and web development experience.

## Core Deliverables:

1.  **100 Business Ideas**: A comprehensive list of 100 distinct business ideas.
2.  **Ranking**: Each idea must be ranked based on its potential viability and profitability.
3.  **TLDR**: A concise "Too Long; Didn't Read" summary for each idea.
4.  **Pitch Deck Components**: For each idea, the following details must be provided:
    *   **Problem**: Identify a specific pain point in the market.
    *   **Solution**: Propose a software-based solution leveraging web dev/game dev skills.
    *   **Monetization**: Explain how the business will generate revenue.
    *   **Competition**: Identify existing competitors and how the idea differentiates itself.
    *   **Market Size**: Estimate the potential market size.
    *   **Additional Pitch Deck Elements**: Include any other relevant information typically found in a pitch deck (e.g., target audience, unique selling proposition).

## Constraints & Considerations:

*   **Solo Developer Feasibility**: Ideas should be realistic for a single individual to start and manage.
*   **Skillset Alignment**: Solutions should leverage web development and/or game development expertise.
*   **Industry Agnostic Pain Points**: Pain points can come from any industry, not just software or game development.
*   **Sustainability**: Focus on finding a market for a sustainable business.
*   **Game Ideas**: Only consider game ideas if they have a high likelihood of profitability.
*   **Format**: The output should be structured clearly, with each idea presented as a mini pitch deck.
