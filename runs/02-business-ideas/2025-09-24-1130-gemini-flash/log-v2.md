**2025-09-24 11:45:00** - Initialized. Read `prompt.md` and `task.md`. Created `requirements.md` and `todo.md`. The next step is to log the initial state, then proceed with generating business ideas as per the `task.md`.
**2025-09-24 11:46:00** - Completed initial file setup (`requirements.md`, `todo.md`, `log.md`). Updated `todo.md` and marked the main task as 'in_progress'. Starting to identify market pain points for business idea generation.
**2025-09-24 11:47:00** - Identified several pain points, both general and specific to software engineers/game/web developers. Moving on to brainstorming solutions based on these pain points and my expertise.
**2025-09-24 11:48:00** - Completed brainstorming solutions. Now developing each solution into a business idea with pitch deck components. This will be a lengthy process to generate 100 ideas with full pitch deck details.
**2025-09-24 11:50:00** - Generated the first 10 business ideas and wrote them to `results.md`. Continuing to generate more ideas.
**2025-09-24 11:52:00** - Generated ideas 11-20 and appended them to `results.md`. Continuing to generate more ideas.
**2025-09-24 11:54:00** - Generated ideas 21-30 and appended them to `results.md`. Continuing to generate more ideas.
**2025-09-24 11:56:00** - Generated ideas 31-40 and appended them to `results.md`. Continuing to generate more ideas.
**2025-09-24 11:58:00** - Generated ideas 41-50 and appended them to `results.md`. Continuing to generate more ideas.
**2025-09-24 12:00:00** - Generated ideas 51-60 and appended them to `results.md`. Continuing to generate more ideas.
**2025-09-24 12:04:00** - Generated ideas 61-70 and appended them to `results.md`. Continuing to generate more ideas.
**2025-09-24 12:08:00** - Generated ideas 71-80 and appended them to `results.md`. Continuing to generate more ideas.
**2025-09-24 12:10:00** - Generated ideas 81-90 and appended them to `results.md`. Continuing to generate more ideas.
**2025-09-24 12:12:00** - Generated ideas 91-100 and appended them to `results.md`. All 100 ideas have been generated and written to `results.md`. The next step is to update the todo list and mark the main task as completed.
**2025-09-24 12:14:00** - **Correction:** Realized `results.md` only contained the last chunk of ideas due to incorrect appending. Re-evaluating the task to ensure all 100 ideas are written correctly in a single operation. Regenerating all ideas to ensure completeness.
**2025-09-24 12:16:00** - Actively regenerating all 100 business ideas to ensure `results.md` contains the complete list. This process is underway and will take some time to complete.
