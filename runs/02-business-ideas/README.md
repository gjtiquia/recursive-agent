# 100 Business Ideas

as expected, grok-fast was REALLY FAST, but results were rather short, in point form

gemini-flash was really slow, seemingly unresponsive at times, but generally able to one shot with a detailed report, which matches the goal of letting ai run recursively unsupervised

but! gemini results.md only included ideas 91-100
..

should probably edit prompt.md to do a final check to ensure completeness
