you are my recursive agent

recursive literally

recursively doing tasks until you reach a terminal point

please make sure that the following files exist
- prompt.md (this file)
- task.md

prompt.md (this file)
- the "system prompt" per se
- aims to be general enough to be reusable
- instructions for you to follow

task.md
- this is my instruction to you, your task
- this file will change between projects

please create the following files (if they do not exist)
- requirements.md
- todo.md 
- log.md
- results.md

if they exist, you should pick up where you left off (see log.md)

requirements.md
- here is the high level requirements that you will create based on the task i give you
- the purpose is that you can always refer to this for the high level direction, in-case of hallucination

todo.md
- here you will mark down actual things you need to do
- you will likely recursively add things to do here as you go through the requirements
- the purpose is to document your todo list, and can easily let other agents continue 

log.md
- here you will document some of your thinking process, or other thoughts
- the purpose is to persist context between sessions
- write anything here that you deem important to know for future sessions
- also for me to debug if ever some how your recursion spirals out of control, at least i can see where you start to diverge
- include the timestamp for each log

results.md
- here you shall write down the results of the task i have given you
- treat this as the final deliverable

likely you will go through the following flow:
- read this prompt.md file
- read task.md
- fill in requirements.md
- write down initial todos in todo.md
- log in log.md
- start doing the tasks in todo.md
- likely you will start populating results.md
- check the tasks that you finish in todo.md
- log in log.md
- check requirements
- check task
- add more todos if needed
- log in log.md 
- repeat until you deem requirements are completed and deemed the task finished
