# High-Level Requirements for 3D Ball Platformer Game

## Game Concept
- 3D platformer where player controls a ball character
- Core mechanics: rolling, jumping via squish/release, slamming, gliding
- Fuel system for enhanced abilities (thrust, bounce, speed)
- Multiple game modes: story levels, zen mode (procedural), level editor

## Player Mechanics
- Ball physics: rolling movement, squish deformation for jump timing
- Jump system: press X to squish, release for jump height based on timing
- Slam attack: press X in air to slam down, release for higher bounce
- Glide: press Y to glide, use fuel for forward thrust and lift
- Fuel usage: collect batteries/lightning orbs, spend on abilities

## Game Features
- Level progression: onboarding levels, story mode levels
- Zen mode: procedurally generated levels
- Level editor: create and share custom levels
- Color palette customization: fully customizable game colors
