i want to create a game

the game is 3D, player is a ball, ball can roll

press X and the ball will squish, release X for the ball to jump, right timing jumps higher

while in air, press X to slam the ball down to squish, release X on right timing, ball jumps even hight

can jump higher and higher until a certain cap determined by game design

press Y to glide

i aim for this game to be a 3D platformer, going through different levels

across the levels can have fuel to collect (batteries? floating lightning?)

use fuel during glide to give forward thrust, which gives lift

use fuel during slam to bounce hight

use fuel during roll to roll faster

will likely have several levels for onboarding and a short "story mode"

have zen mode for procedurally generated level 

have level editor for creating your own level and sharing with others

the color palette of the game should be entirely customizable

probably free to play on mobile...? monetize by... adding limits? like energy?

probably paid $5 on steam fully featured?

you are my one-man team
- analyze my idea
- give me feedback
- think about holes in my design
- do market research and see if have any similar game 
- if so, analyze and give me a report
- think about monetization
- any other things that you think is useful
- you may also ramble on how to technically achieve this if you want
